Ewneta Weyzero and you will attempt to agree on a single arbitrator. If agreement is not possible, each party will select its own arbitrator. Each party's arbitrator will, in turn, confer and select a single arbitrator. The arbitrator will base the decision on the evidence presented and following these Terms and governing law, including statutory and judicial authority. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. The arbitrator will issue a written decision, which will contain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding upon all parties. YOU AND Ewneta Weyzero AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS, SUIT, INJURY, HARM, LOSS OR DAMAGE AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Ewneta Weyzero AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER Ewneta Weyzero USERS. The arbitration shall be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances; and the judgment of the arbitration award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. You will bear only those costs of arbitration that you would have borne had you brought a claim covered by this arbitration provision in court. If you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Ewneta Weyzero will pay as much of the arbitration fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, disputes may be brought before an administrative agency to the extent applicable law requires access to an agency notwithstanding the existence of this arbitration provision. Nothing in this arbitration provision shall be construed to: (i) relieve any party of the duty to exhaust administrative remedies by filing a charge or complaint with an administrative agency and obtaining a right to sue notice, where otherwise required by law; or (ii) prevent either party from cooperating with a federal or state body as required by law. However, you understand that you are not entitled to a double recovery or eligible to receive any monetary benefit from any action brought by an administrative agency except as required by law. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or be represented by an attorney or another representative. Once we receive your arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims we may have against you. If a tribunal or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction determines that the arbitration provision is unenforceable, you agree that the exclusive forum and/or venue for any controversy, claim, suit, injury, harm, loss or damage arising from or in any way related to the use, inability to use or provision of these Terms shall be any State Court or Federal Court, and you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts for purposes of any such proceeding. You and Ewneta Weyzero agree that any dispute is personal to you and Ewneta Weyzero and that any such controversy, claim, suit, injury, harm, loss or damage shall be brought on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated with any controversy, claim, suit, injury, harm, loss or damage of any other party. However, this representative action waiver may be severed if it would otherwise render these Terms unenforceable.

       19. Injunction
       </Text>

       <Text style={styles.termTextTwo}>
       You agree that any material breach of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to Ewneta Weyzero for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, Ewneta Weyzero will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if Ewneta Weyzero seeks such an injunction.
